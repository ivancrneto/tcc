PyPI Information Example
========================

This example was used in the Creating GUI Applications with PyQt and Qt
Designer presentation at PyCon UK 2007. It shows how widgets and layouts are
set up in Qt Designer and used in a PyQt4 application.

It relies on a working network connection in order to access the Python Package
Index at pypi.python.org.

The example is designed to be run from the directory in which it is located.
It is not designed to be installed for system-wide use. To run it, simply
launch the main.pyw file from a file browser, or type

  python main.pyw

at the command line.
