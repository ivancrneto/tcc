MathTran Equation Viewer Example
================================

This example was used in the Creating GUI Applications with PyQt and Qt
Designer presentation at PyCon UK 2007. It shows how widgets, layouts, actions
and resources are set up in Qt Designer and used in a PyQt4 application.

It relies on a working network connection in order to access the MathTran
service at www.mathtran.org. If you intend to use the facilities of this
service extensively, please consider installing your own MathTran server
locally.

The example is designed to be run from the directory in which it is located.
It is not designed to be installed for system-wide use. To run it, simply
launch the main.pyw file from a file browser, or type

  python main.pyw

at the command line.
