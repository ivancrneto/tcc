Creating GUI Applications with PyQt and Qt Designer
===================================================

It has been widely known for some time in the Python community that Python
is a good choice of language for developing applications of any size and
complexity, mainly because it takes care of troublesome low-level tasks, such
as memory management, and provides high-level data types that scale well.

`PyQt <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/>`_ is a set of bindings to Qt,
a C++ framework for Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications that is known
for it's intuitive and well designed API. Just as with Python, PyQt frees
developers from the more tedious tasks associated with software development,
allowing more time to be spent on writing maintainable cross-platform code to
implement all those new features requested by users.

Nonetheless, the task of creating a GUI application can be made even easier.
`Qt Designer <http://trolltech.com/products/qt/features/designer>`_, the GUI
design tool supplied with Qt, can be used to design user interfaces for PyQt
applications. Additionally, specialized application controls written in Python
can be installed alongside the standard Qt controls in Qt Designer, making it
easier to experiment with user interface ideas at the design stage.

In this talk, I will use examples to show how Qt Designer's capabilities as a
GUI design tool can be used to make the development of PyQt applications easier
and more intuitive for developers and user interface designers. I will also
demonstrate how simple it is to take specialized widgets and make them
available for use in Qt Designer.
